<p>We’re committed to business practices that support and respect human rights and align with the UN Global Compact principles.<br> Our Global Human Rights policy sets out standards, expectations and commitments in relation to our responsibility to respect and promote human rights within our own company and to not, knowingly, contribute to the violations of human rights by other parties.



<p>Code of Business Conduct.
<br>We operate in countries with a broad range of cultures and business practices. Making it more important than ever that we are guided by a clear and consistent code of business ethics and guidelines for all of our colleagues around the world. We must always adhere to the highest standards of business integrity and ethics, as well as respect and comply with all applicable national and supra-national laws and regulations.

<p>Global Whistleblower Policy.
<br>At Anheuser-Busch InBev, NA/SV (“AB InBev” or the “Company”), we believe that the true measure of success is not just the results we achieve, but how we achieve them. For this reason, there should be no gap between what we say and what we do. A crucially important element of this is the commitment to an open culture where people feel secure in seeking advice and raising concerns.



<p>Diversity and Inclusion Policy.
<br>AB InBev is committed to a work environment where all colleagues are respected and valued. We launched our first Global Diversity Policy in 2018 to provide guidelines for what is expected of all our leaders and colleagues to treat others with respect and cultivate, encourage, maintain and preserve an inclusive environment.



<p>Global Anti-Harassment Anti-Discrimination Policy.
<br>At AB InBev, our dream is to bring people together for a better world. In fulfilling our dream, each of us is responsible for promoting a culture that results in a safe, positive, diverse and inclusive work environment where people can flourish. The purpose of this Global Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy (“Policy”) is to ensure our colleagues can thrive in an inclusive workplace free from all forms of harassment, including unfair discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. This Policy protects our colleagues against inappropriate actions that are unwanted and unwelcome and/or which create an intimidating, offensive, or hostile work environment.




<p>Global Responsible Sourcing Policy.
<br>We look at our entire value chain for opportunities to reduce costs, limit environmental impacts and improve economic stability among our many suppliers and surrounding communities. This includes ensuring that the companies from which we purchase products and services are operating in an ethical and responsible manner. Our responsible sourcing policy communicates our expectations in these areas and how we are assessing our suppliers’ performance through a variety of engagements.



<br>We also take part in industry and NGO initiatives that seek to improve supply chain performance. We are a member of AIM-Progress, a global forum of consumer goods companies sponsored by the European Brands Association and the Grocery Manufacturers Association. The group's purpose is to promote responsible supply chain and sourcing standards covering labor practices, health and safety, environmental management and business integrity. As a member, we report audits of our suppliers to AIM-Progress. We are also a member of SEDEX, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to driving ethical and responsible business practices in global supply chains. SEDEX is an effective management solution that helps us reduce risk, protect our reputation and improve our supply chain practices.




<p>Responsible Marketing & Communications Code.
<br>As a leading global brewer, we take great pride in producing and marketing our beers with quality and care. Our Responsible Marketing and Communications Code helps us strive to ensure that our communications are honest, truthful, in keeping with contemporary standards of good taste, and sensitive to cultural differences between markets. Compliance with the Code is mandatory for all of our marketing, sales, promotion and communications efforts, and includes both traditional, as well as digital media.




<p>Product Quality.
<br>Our passion for beer transfers to our uncompromising commitment to quality that ensures our consumers enjoy the freshest, best-tasting beers. We follow a comprehensive quality management system at our breweries and facilities to maintain product safety, and we extend these standards to our suppliers as well. If consumers should have any questions, comments or issues, they may call our toll-free customer service number printed on our packaging and speak to a company representative.

<p>Public Policy.
<br>Like many businesses, we participate in the political process in various ways at all levels of government. This includes bipartisan support of candidates and political organizations throughout the countries where we operate. We also actively develop strong working relationships with public officials, emerging leaders and influential members of the communities where we live and work. In many cases, we work with outside consultants who are familiar with the legislative process, as well as the federal, state and local laws relevant to the company's business. All of our public policy expenditures and activities comply with relevant federal, state and local laws, as well as with our own approval processes. We strive to ensure that our actions work to support the best interests of our company, employees, shareholders, and consumers, as well as the communities in which we do business.
